        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 medium lime,cut into 3 wedges divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon white sugar,or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>        
            <li>1 1/2 fluid ounces white rum</li>
            <li>1/2 cup club soda, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
