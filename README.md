This project marks my first successful completion within The Odin Project. It's a basic recipe website where I've compiled recipes for my favorite foods.

Learning Highlights

Throughout this project, I've acquired fundamental skills in HTML5, including:

•Creating headings and structuring content within a webpage.
•Implementing links to connect different pages within the site.
•Incorporating images to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage.

Project Overview


The project comprises multiple HTML files organized in directories:
•index.html: This serves as the main page, displaying a list of recipes.
•recipes directory: It houses individual recipe pages.
•Each recipe page contains details such as an      image of the dish, a description, ingredients list, and steps.
